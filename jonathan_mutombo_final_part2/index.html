   <ul>
     <li>using available tutorial to have a better understanding of lessons that seem confusing.</li><br>
    <li>organizing themselves to have enough time of commitment to this course. They will be able to avoid loosing the track with others.</li><br>
    <li>trusting themselves and having the courage to ask for help when stuck. Especially for those without previous knowledge on this field.</li>
