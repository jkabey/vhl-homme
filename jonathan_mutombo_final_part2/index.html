    <h1> Final Part 2</h1><hr>
  <h2>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h2>
    <p>Before taking this class, I have not any knowledge on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.I have the understanding that behind each app that I was using were a bunch of codes but I haven't an idea of the structures and components. </p>
    <h2>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h2>
    <p>To build my portfolio, I have used a template that I modify to my taste.</p>
    
    <h2>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</h2>
    <p>The most challenging part of my porfolio was linking the pages so that the audience could navigate easily among them and styling the coffee machine. For days, I couldn't find the right path to connect all the 6 pages and couldn't display the coffee as in my imagination.</p>
    <h2>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </h2>
    <p> I had never been more nervous for a class than I was to start this one. As I wasn't familiar with web development, I feared I would be out of place in the class. Some assignments I completed were nothing like any others I had been assigned in the past. From that moment on I knew the class was going to shake things up for me. They stretched my thinking and took me out of my comfort zone. I definitely needed that push to understand that wweb development is about giving your all to find a solution. Eitheir for bringing up something completly new or transforming the existing one. </p>

    <h2>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
    <p>I wil recommend to future students taking this class:<br>
   <ul>
     <li>using available tutorial to have a better understanding of lessons that seem confusing.</li><br>
    <li>organizing themselves to have enough time of commitment to this course. They will be able to avoid loosing the track with others.</li><br>
    <li>trusting themselves and having the courage to ask for help when stuck. Especially for those without previous knowledge on this field.</li>
      <li>avoid missing deadline as you wouldn't be able able to produce you best work while speeding up to get the next assignment done.</li>
      </ul>
